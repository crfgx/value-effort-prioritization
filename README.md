# About Value & Effort Prioritization Framework

https://www.productplan.com/glossary/value-vs-complexity/

Product managers frequently use the value vs. complexity framework (and variations of it) to standardize a set of decision-making parameters. These parameters (usually, as the name suggests, value and complexity) can apply to all features, product enhancements, fixes, and other initiatives competing for space on the product roadmap. This objective prioritization technique enables product teams to apply strategic and quantifiable reasoning to decisions about which initiatives to prioritize and which to shelve.

The methodology is straightforward. A product team builds a graph or prioritization matrix with axes for “Business Value” and “Complexity/Effort.” The chart is then broken down into quadrants as follows: high value, low complexity; high value, high complexity; low value, low complexity; and low value, high complexity. The team will then evaluate each initiative and plot it on the graph, providing a visual representation of every initiative’s anticipated value and required effort.
